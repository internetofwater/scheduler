# The format for INPUT_FILES should be such that `ls ${INPUT_FILES}` lists all
# input files. CAT_INPUT_FILES should write a concatenation of all input files
# to stdout. For example, if your input files are gzipped, you can write `zcat
# ${INPUT_FILES}`. Regarding SETTINGS_JSON, look at the other Qleverfiles for
# examples. Several batches of size `num-triples-per-batch` are kept in RAM at 
# the same time; increasing this, increases the memory usage but speeds up the
# loading process.
